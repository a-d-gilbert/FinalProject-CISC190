# FinalProject-CISC190

This is a project I undertook to translate my c++ OpenCV work to Java and continue my work in that language.
It was done for my intro to Java programming course to introduce myself to JavaFX and the implementation 
of the cascade classifier system in OpenCV, I decided to also translate my previous OpenCV work to Java.
